# 🚀 Time Complexity Classification using CodeBERT

## 📌 Overview
This project aims to **automatically classify the time complexity** of given code snippets using **CodeBERT**, a transformer-based model specialized for programming languages. The dataset consists of **5000+ labeled data points**, making it a valuable resource for analyzing algorithm efficiency.

## 🔥 Features
- **Automated Time Complexity Analysis** using NLP techniques.
- **Pretrained CodeBERT Model** fine-tuned on a dataset of code snippets.
- Supports **Java** programming language.
- **Interactive visualizations** for result interpretation.

## 📊 Dataset
- The dataset contains **5000+ samples** with labeled time complexities (O(1), O(log n), O(n), O(n²), etc.).
- It is sourced from competitive programming problems and open-source repositories.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Python** (for preprocessing and model training)
- **CodeBERT** (for feature extraction & classification)
- **Scikit-learn** (for ML model training)
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** (for visualizations)
- **SHAP** (for explainability)

## 🎯 Results & Insights
- Achieved **high accuracy** in classifying common time complexities.
- **CodeBERT performed significantly better** than traditional ML models in understanding code patterns.
- The model can **predict complexities for unseen code snippets**, helping developers optimize their algorithms.
- The model has an explainable component using SHAP.

## 📌 Future Improvements
